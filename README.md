This repository contains information on how to use events in Terasology's ECS. The module contains code for an example entity called `ConsoleEntity` which can be spawned in game with the command `spawnPrefab`. Activating the entity with `E` should produce 2 messages in the in-game console in a consistent order. For more information, see the wiki.
